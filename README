Things that might be missing for DuckDB:
- foreign and primary key constraints:
  - dropping them
  - generally all "ALTER TABLE" statements in JdbcStatementBuilderComponent must be looked at
- in-memory tests, but also file based db tests
- Database creation factories

- Implement DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo endpoint in DuckDB JDBC Driver
- TODO "Check constraints" support

- DuckDB returns -1 when no changes where made (like CREATE TABLE); slick assumes 0
org.duckdb.DuckDBPreparedStatement.getUpdateCountInternal

- summary of the main issues:
  - alter table for key constraints not allowed
  - duckdb validates key constraints at `create table` time, meaning the order of the table creation matters (since also
    the constraints cannot be added after table has been created due to missing alter table)
    sqlite also doesn't have alter statement, but it validates keys only at insert time.
  - missing duckdb jdbc driver option for `setBlob` --> workaround
  - missing duckdb jdbc driver implementation for getTypeInfo, getUDTs

- Varchar length is not enforced -- docs recommend using check constraints instead.
  TODO: automatically convert slick length requirements to a check constraint

- TODO: UpsertBuilder, ModelBuilder, QueryBuilder and other things from Postgres profile; understand it and see
        if necessary for DuckDB



- TODO: select a license
- TODO: write an actual Readme
